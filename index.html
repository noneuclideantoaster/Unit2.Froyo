    <h1>No, For Real, I Hate Frozen Yogurt</h1>
    <p>This assignment causes me visceral pain, and I feel like I deserve financial compensation.</p>
    <p>Don't get me started on how much I hate Gelato. The entirety of Italy will yell at me.</p>
    <p>They're just mad because New York pizza is better than theirs.</p>
